## Abstract
This article investigates the relationship among stock bubbles, inflation and output. Following preceding studies, asymmetric effect should be considered with the presence of stock market. The test utilizes non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model. The model fits better to the bubbles rather than fundamentals, and cointegrations are found in both models. The asymmetric effect only appears in fundamentals. Combining with monetary policies in the U.S., conclusion is made that the stock prices tend to be mispriced when inflation and output drop.
